<-----------INTRODUCTION-------->
  
 Given a graph and a source vertex src in graph, find shortest paths from src to all vertices in the given graph. The graph may contain negative weight edges. 
 
 <-----------Algorithm------------->
  
Following are the detailed steps.
Input: Graph and a source vertex src 
Output: Shortest distance to all vertices from src. If there is a negative weight cycle, then shortest distances are not calculated, negative weight cycle is reported.
1) This step initializes distances from the source to all vertices as infinite and distance to the source itself as 0. Create an array dist[] of size |V| with all values as infinite except dist[src] where src is source vertex.
  
2) This step calculates shortest distances. Do following |V|-1 times where |V| is the number of vertices in given graph. 
…..a) Do following for each edge u-v 
………………If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then update dist[v] 
………………….dist[v] = dist[u] + weight of edge uv

3) This step reports if there is a negative weight cycle in graph. Do following for each edge u-v 
……If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then “Graph contains negative weight cycle” 
The idea of step 3 is, step 2 guarantees the shortest distances if the graph doesn’t contain a negative weight cycle. If we iterate through all edges one more time and get a 
shorter path for any vertex, then there is a negative weight cycle.

<------Notes-----> 
  
1) Negative weights are found in various applications of graphs. For example, instead of paying cost for a path, we may get some advantage if we follow the path.
2) Bellman-Ford works better (better than Dijkstra’s) for distributed systems. Unlike Dijkstra’s where we need to find the minimum value of all vertices, in Bellman-Ford, edges 
are considered one by one.                                                                  
3) Bellman-Ford does not work with undirected graph with negative edges as it will declared as negative cycle.
